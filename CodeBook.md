# Code Book

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in `tidy_data.txt`.

## Data

The tidy_data.txt data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the Variables section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables

## Variables

### Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject (ranges from 1 to 30)
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
               (ranges from 1 to 6)
* `metric` - The name of the feature that was recorded
* `mean` - The mean value of the feature 

### Activity Labels

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test

## Transformations

The zip file containing the source data is located at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The following transformations were applied to the data:

1. Features corresponding to the mean and standard devation were extracted.
2. The train and the test data were merged together.
3. The names of the columns were changed to make them more human readable using the following set of       rules:
   -Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed
   -The initial f and t were expanded to frequencyDomain and timeDomain respectively.
   -Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude,             Frequency, Mean, and StandardDeviation respectively.
   -Replaced (supposedly incorrect as per source's features_info.txt file) BodyBody with Body.
4. Means of the values of a feature for each subject and activity were taken.

To obtain the tidy_data.txt file run the `run_analysis.R` file.
